DETECTION ENGINE:
- create a detection_engine_ctx for storing the sig list, packet entry point, other stuff
- many group heads seem to have the same number of sigs. See if we can save memory by detecting similars... the savings are in the pattern matcher.
 -> this is done, and works. However it can be taken further. It's not the group heads that should be compared, but the mpm contexts...

- implement flow as a prefilter
- implement protocol as a prefilter
- implement src and dst ports as prefilters


WU-MANBER:

- Consider using dynamic/variable hash sizes. A wm_ctx is quite big (512kb) even for small pattern sets.


MAIN:
- move packet preallocation into it's own function
- create a cleanup function


CUSTOM LOGGING:
- idea: add a logging module that can be told to output things based on flowvars
